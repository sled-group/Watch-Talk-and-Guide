Pour-over Coffee

Ingredients
12 oz water
25 grams whole coffee beans

Tools and Utensils
2-cup liquid measuring cup electric kettle
kitchen scale
coffee grinder
filter cone dripper (stainless steel)
paper basket filter (standard 8-12 cup size) 12-ounce coffee mug
thermometer
timer (optional)

Steps
1. Measure 12 ounces of cold water and transfer to a kettle.
2. While the water is boiling, assemble the filter cone. Place the dripper on top of a coffee mug.
3. Prepare the filter insert by folding the paper filter in half to create a semi-circle, and in half again
to create a quarter-circle. Place the paper filter in the dripper and spread open to create a cone.
4. Weigh the coffee beans and grind until the coffee grounds are the consistency of coarse sand,
about 20 seconds. Transfer the grounds to the filter cone.
5. Once the water has boiled, check the temperature. The water should be between 195-205
degrees Fahrenheit or between 91-96 degrees Celsius. If the water is too hot, let it cool briefly.
6. Pour a small amount of water in the filter to wet the grounds. Wait about 30 seconds for coffee
to bloom. You will see small bubbles or foam on the coffee grounds during this step.
7. Slowly pour the rest of the water over the grounds in a circular motion. Do not overfill beyond
the top of the paper filter.
8. Let the coffee drain completely into the mug before removing the dripper. Discard the paper
filter and coffee grounds.
